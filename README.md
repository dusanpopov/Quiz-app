# Quiz-app
Quiz app made with Open Trivia API and vanilla JavaScript.

App consumes 10 random questions of different difficulties from an API and displays them to the user. User chooses one of four answers and then proceedes to the next one (doesn't matter if the answer is right or wrong). Correct answer is worth 10 points, wrong worth 0.

When quiz finishes, user saves his score into local storage which can be accessed later.
